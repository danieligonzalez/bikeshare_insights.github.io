Bikeshare Company in Chicago Illinois.

The company has bikeshare stations all over the city.  
They have two kinds of customers, annual members who pay a subscription fee, and casual riders who pay per ride.
They have found that Annual Members are much more profitable than Casual Riders, so they would like to find the key differences between the two so that the marketing team can effectively reach the Casual Riders.

I started by downloading the past 12 Months of bikeshare data.

It was too much for excel, so I opened them in SQL and started to familiarize myself with the data.

There were three different bike types that were used.  Electric, Docked, and Classic.  I queried the tables to find what kind of bikes the Members used vs. the Casual Riders.
